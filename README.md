# DFTBML: A Machine-Learned Density Functional Based Tight Binding Model for the Deep Learning of Chemical Hamiltonians 
---
DFTBML provides a systematic way to parameterize the Density Functional-based Tight Binding (DFTB) semiempirical quantum chemical method for different chemical systems by learning the underlying Hamiltonian parameters rather than fitting the potential energy surface directly. By training to *ab initio* data in a manner analogous to that used to train other deep learning models, DFTBML adheres to traditional machine learning protocols while also incorporating significantly more physics by computing chemical properties via quantum chemical formalisms. This approach to semiempirical machine learning brings many advantages, namely high data efficiency, low computational cost, high accuracy, and deep interpretability.
