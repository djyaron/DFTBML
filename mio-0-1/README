The set has been developed for organic molecules including O, N, C, H
[PRB98], and S [JMS01]. Extensive test for molecules
consisting of O N C and H can be found in [JCP05] and for the
performance of S in [JMS01] and for the whole SONCH set in [JCTC06].

The ONCH set works quite well for peptide structures and conformation
energies [CP01], the geometries of H-bonded systems are well
reproduced while bonding energies are slightly understimated [PSS00].

Including dispersion energies, even stacked complexes like DNA base
pairs are well treated [JCP01].
